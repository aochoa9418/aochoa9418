## üß†About me
I'm a 25-year-old tech enthusiast with a **B.B.A. in Cybersecurity**, a **minor in Cyberforensics**, and a **Master‚Äôs in Management of Technology** from the **University of Texas at San Antonio**.  

I recently completed an internship at **Apple** as an **Engineering Program Manager**, where I supported cross-functional teams in product development and process optimization. I'm currently **open to new opportunities** where I can combine my technical background, management experience, and passion for innovation to help build meaningful technology.  

I love exploring how technology works behind the scenes ‚Äî from servers and automation to Linux customization. My main PC runs **Fedora 43**, and I maintain a **home server** that hosts **Plex** and several other self-hosted services.  

Recently, I‚Äôve been diving deeper into **coding and software development**, blending my cybersecurity foundation with hands-on experimentation. I enjoy creating projects that make systems run smoother, automate workflows, or just add a bit of fun.

I'm **slowly building my GitHub** to showcase my projects, document my **troubleshooting processes**, and share what I learn along the way. My goal is to turn this space into both a personal reference hub and a growing portfolio of the things I build, break, and improve.
